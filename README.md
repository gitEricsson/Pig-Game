## Overview

### About

Pig is a straightforward, amusing, and funny dice game for two players. The goal of the game is to be the first to score 100 points.

### Game Conditions

- The player rolls the dice again each time until either a 1 is rolled or the player chooses to "hold"
- The player's turn ends and the next person takes over if they roll a 1.
- The player's turn continues if they roll any other number, which is added to their turn total.
- It becomes the following player's turn if they decide to "hold," in which case their turn total is added to their overall score.

### The Challenge
